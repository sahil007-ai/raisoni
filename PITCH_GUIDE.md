# Plan4U — Master Pitch Guide

> **One-liner:** Plan4U is an AI-powered, gamified study planner that turns exam prep into a game — with XP, streaks, badges, and Duolingo-style guilt-trip notifications that keep students coming back.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Students face three core struggles when preparing for exams:

1. **No structure** — They have a syllabus but no actionable daily plan
2. **No motivation** — Studying feels like a chore with no reward feedback loop
3. **No accountability** — It's easy to skip a day and never come back

Existing tools either solve scheduling (Google Calendar) or motivation (Duolingo) — but **no tool does both for academic study**.

---

## 💡 The Solution — Plan4U

Plan4U is a **full-stack study planner** that combines:

| Pillar | How Plan4U Solves It |
|--------|---------------------|
| 🧠 **AI Scheduling** | Paste your syllabus → get a personalized daily study plan in seconds |
| 🎮 **Gamification** | XP, levels, streaks, badges, and confetti — learning feels like a game |
| ✅ **Task Verification** | Students must submit proof (URL/media) to earn full XP — real accountability |
| 😤 **Guilt-Trip Notifications** | Duolingo-style push notifications that escalate from gentle to nuclear |
| 📊 **Analytics** | Charts and stats showing study hours, task completion, and streak trends |
| ⏱️ **Pomodoro Timer** | Built-in focus/break timer with session tracking and XP rewards |

## 🌟 Key Differentiators

### 1. AI Syllabus Parser
Upload a PDF or paste syllabus text → the parser extracts courses, exam dates, units, and topics automatically. No external API calls — it's a local heuristic engine that works offline.

### 2. Duolingo-Style Guilt-Trip System
Our notification engine has **4 escalating severity tiers** with 30+ unique messages:

| 🟢 Gentle (1hr) | *"It's okay if not, but I'd like it if you did."* |
|---|---|
| 🟡 Moderate (4hr) | *"Don't let this streak become a not-streak."* |
| 🔴 Aggressive (12hr) | *"Don't make me come over there."* |
| 💀 Nuclear (24hr+) | *"Your study plan wrote a goodbye letter. Don't let it end like this."* |

Even the **dismiss button** guilt-trips you: *"Your textbook just shed a tear. 📖💧"*

### 3. Proof-Based Task Verification
Students can't just mark tasks "done" — they must:
- Submit a **URL** (to an assignment, quiz, or resource) → +100 XP
- Upload **media proof** (screenshot, PDF, photo) → +150 XP
- Or skip verification → only +25 XP (with a guilt message)

### 4. Works Online & Offline
The app gracefully degrades:
- **With backend** → data in SQLite database, synced across sessions
- **Without backend** → falls back to `localStorage`, fully functional
